# Video-scaling-HLS-implementation

Video scaling is most efficiently accomplished in high-volume systems dealing with standardised image sizes, such as HD television, by using application-specific standard products (ASSPs). Many video applications, however, require solutions that can handle configurable image sizes and varying levels of quality, such as video surveillance, broadcast display and monitoring, video conferencing, and specialty displays. 
This frequently necessitates the development of custom scaling algorithms. 


Video scaling, whether upscaling or downscaling, is the
process of generating pixels that did not exist in the original
image.


FPGAs with a slew of high-performance DSP structures are ideal for such algorithms, and FPGA vendors are starting to offer user-configurable video-scaling IP blocks that are speedily configured for any application.
